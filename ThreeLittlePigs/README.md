Once upon a time there were three little pigs, who lived happily with their mother in a beautiful little house, with chintz antimaccassars on the chairs, doilies on all the tables, and the neatest, tiniest kitchen you ever saw.

Unfortunately, the three little pigs were rapidly turning into three big pigs, and one day their mother told them it was time that they moved out into their own houses.  She gave them each an allowance, and told them to use it wisely.

The first little pig said “I will contact a big building firm, and make a contract with them to build me a beautiful house.  I don’t need to know how housebuilding works, I just need to know what I want!”

The second little pig said “I will contact a big rental firm, and make a contract with them to provide a beautiful house for me.  I don’t need to know what a house even is, because I can amend the description after I move in!”

The third little pig said “I will project manage the building of my own house”.  His brothers laughed and laughed.  The first little pig said “You will have to learn all sorts of complicated things!  You will spend hours and hours on it.  Much better to get an expert in”.  The second little pig said “I’m going to build a good working relationship with an expert provided to me by the company!  I’m not going to do all that work when they will do it for me.”


Then the first little pig sat down and wrote a list.  He wrote: 
* Walls
* Doors
* Fireplace
* Chimney

And he felt very pleased with himself.  He phoned up a big building firm, BB Wolf Ltd, and told them he wanted them to build him a house.  They sent round a manager, who sat down with the little pig to discuss his requirements.  He took the first little pig out for a nice meal, and told him what a great house they were going to build him.

Then BB Wolf Ltd started work.  They used straw as the main building material, because it was cheap, and the contract didn’t specify the building material.  They made the chimney out of a bit left over from another project, which made it cheaper for them, even though it didn’t fit very well.  The fireplace looked nice, although an expert would have said it was surprisingly close to the straw walls…..  But when it was all fixed together, the first little pig thought his house looked fit for a king, and moved in straightaway.

The second little pig called up Lupine Plc, and instructed them to fulfil all his requirements to the letter.  These were the same as those of the first little pig, but at least he had the foresight to insist on the services company rectifying errors at their own expense.

Lupine Plc built the second little pig a beautiful house out of wood.  The wood had been treated to make it fireproof, and tiles were used around the fireplace as an additional safety measure.  The second little pig was delighted.  He walked all round the house, checking that there were no snags, and moved in soon after.

The third little pig wrote his list.  It had the same elements as his brothers.  Then he started researching common building failures, and added ‘fireproofing’ to the list.  Then ‘wet rot proofing’ and ‘dry rot proofing’.  Then ‘plumbing’ and ‘roof tiles’ went on too.  He spent quite a lot of time doing this, when he could have been out earning a living.

The third little pig went down to the market and looked for a builder.  BB Wolf and Lupine both had stands at the market, but he wanted a relationship of equals, not a little pig and a big … company, in case anything went wrong.  So he settled with some of the local farm boys to come and build his house.  He chose brick as the main material.  It was more expensive, but proof against all sorts of problems that the little pig had discovered were often found in the building industry.

The first and second little pigs sat in their armchairs in their houses, watching all his efforts, laughing and giggling to themselves about how much cleverer they were, saving all this effort.

The third little pig’s house took longer to build than the others.  This was partly because he realised, halfway through the build, that he would like a bathroom, and some extra work had to be undertaken to deliver that.  The other two little pigs had also realised that they didn’t have a bathroom, but they told themselves they didn’t mind walking to the end of the garden to use the privy.

By the time the last house was completed, building season was over, and winter was approaching.  It was cold.  Each of the little pigs built a fire in the fireplace.  Whooosh!  The first little pig’s house caught fire, and in only a few minutes, it was burnt to a cinder.  Luckily he got out, and he telephoned BB Wolf Ltd to complain.  They told him that the build had been completed according to spec, and it was his own problem.  They also asked when he would be paying their bill.  The little pig realised, with a shock, that his wallet had been in the house, and he had no money to pay BB Wolf.  The nice chap on the phone explained that they had what they called “alternative payment plans” available.  

Nobody ever saw the first little pig again.

The second little pig’s house didn’t burn down.  But the heat did make the wooden walls twist out of shape.  The second little pig called Lupine Plc and they came round and fixed the walls.  They also asked for their bill to be paid.  Then the same thing happened the next night, and they came round again.  But by next week, once the payment had cleared, Lupine Plc refused to take the little pig’s calls.  He called and called and called, but they didn’t answer, and the wood got more and more twisted, until the wall was more like a fence.  In desperation, the second little pig called in BB Wolf Ltd, who sent round a man to fix the wood.  But as he had to pay for every fix, he ran out of money in no time, and then, one day, he was never seen again.  Just a scrap of paper was found, which said “alternative payment plan”.

The third little pig sat in his brick house, and pulled out his wallet.  It was a lot thinner than he had hoped it might be, but he was warm and safe in his house.  What’s more, he knew every brick, every pipe, and every tile in the place, and he could arrange with the lowest bidder to fix anything which broke.
