# A DevOps Fairy Tale

Once upon a time there was a queen who liked eggs. Boiled eggs. Poached eggs. Ostrich eggs. Faberge eggs. Eggs!

She was married to a King, who naturally wanted to impress his Queen. One day he ordered his two princes to create a surprise egg-based project for her. “What sort of eggs?” asked the Princes. “Golden, obviously”, said the King. “Golden, shiny, pretty, egg-shaped eggs. Oh, get ON with it!” 

He gave them six months, which they both agreed would be plenty of time. 

The foolish prince rode immediately into the hills to meet with the dwarves. He set them to work mining ore which they would smelt, shape, and polish to create a gorgeous, massive, golden egg.

The wise prince asked his cupbearer to come with him. The cupbearer was an expert on delivering drinks to the royal table, and the prince thought he would be useful. The cupbearer asked the prince to wait while he packed his trays and cups to ensure he could deliver anything small he might need to carry. The prince was a touch irritated, but agreed. Eventually they rode off to the dwarven halls.

The foolish prince laughed when they arrived. His dwarves had already started work, and the pile of gold ore which was to become the egg was a foot high.

The wise prince consulted with his cupbearer on how to start work, and the cupbearer asked the dwarves to build an egg mould. The foolish prince smiled, but inside he was laughing: his rival knew nothing! He wasn’t even going to start mining! The foolish prince knew that his ore pile was nearly two feet high.

The dwarves finished making the egg mould, and picked up their picks and shovels. Then, again, the wise prince asked the cupbearer what to do next. He replied that the dwarves should build a smelter. The dwarves raised their eyebrows, put down the mining equipment they had prepared, and got out their brooms to clear space for a smelter.

The foolish prince hugged himself in glee. His pile of ore was now three feet high.

Eventually, the smelter was complete, and the wise prince gave permission to start mining. On the first day, the dwarves brought out a handful of gold ore, smelted it, shaped it, and handed it to the cupbearer, who took it to the palace on a tray. The king was not very impressed, but the cupbearer assured him that it was only the end of the first month, and that six months was a long time.  “If you say so”, said the King.  “Just GET ON with it.”

The foolish prince laughed out loud at the wise prince and looked at his ore pile, which was now up to his shoulders.

The next week, the wise prince sent his cupbearer off with another mini egg.

The foolish prince looked on in pride and confidence as his pile of ore grew. He now had a pile of gold ore as tall as himself, while wearing his biggest hat.

The foolish prince smiled contentedly as his ore pile grew higher than his horse. In fact, higher than his horse wearing his biggest hat.

The foolish prince decided the ore pile was big enough, and it was time to consider how to build and deliver his egg. He ordered the dwarves to start crushing and smelting. The dwarves built a smelter and started work. It took longer than expected. They didn’t have enough charcoal in store. They ordered more charcoal and began to make a mould.

The foolish prince tutted with irritation at the delays, but his egg slowly took shape. They couldn’t use all the ore, as there still wasn’t enough charcoal, but they used a lot of it. However, as the gold cooled in the mould, it cracked. It turned out that it was too big and didn’t cool evenly. The dwarves said this was not a problem, they would polish it out. It wouldn’t take too long.

Finally, the foolish prince’s large and valuable egg was ready. He sent to the castle for horsemen to escort the egg. The message came back that the soldiers were busy guarding a royal hunting party, and would not be available until evening. The foolish prince thought that might be better anyway, as any villagers would be asleep then, and there would be less risk of an attack. The soldiers arrived that night, and the foolish prince instructed them to take the egg.

The soldiers’ captain explained that, with such a high value item, they would have to conduct a risk assessment by sending outriders into the forest for half a mile in every direction to check for vagabond camps. They would begin immediately.

The prince began to worry. It was after midnight, and the egg had to be at the palace first thing in the morning. Finally, the captain agreed that the route was safe. He instructed the dwarves to load the egg onto the cart. The egg was very heavy, and the cart could only be pulled along at walking pace.

They walked, all night. The foolish prince was worried sick. But they arrived safely at the castle, where the egg was placed on a velvet cushion.  Carefully, because of the crack.

In the morning, the foolish prince was still awake, desperately drinking coffee and trying to look polished himself, when the wise prince came downstairs, well slept and freshly showered, and ate a fine breakfast. Finally, the king and queen arrived to view the eggs. 

In the end, the queen decided she liked both, but wasn’t sure which was best. She asked the King to weigh both offerings to decide which was best: the giant golden egg and the pile of mini eggs. The foolish prince was worried that his egg might crack again with too much handling, but it didn’t.  Then, to everyone’s surprise, they weighed exactly the same!

The queen pronounced herself delighted with the king and the princes. But then her face fell. She turned to her husband. “Darling...” she said. “Do you remember, at our wedding..? You promised me my weight in gold. Neither of these are quite as heavy as me.” (She was a rather large woman)

The king only looked flustered for a second, then smiled at his wife. “Of course dear” he said, then turned to the princes. “Quickly!” he shouted, “get more gold until the eggs weigh as much as the queen! NOW! GET ON WITH IT!“

The wise prince smiled, and sent his cupbearer to ask the dwarves to prepare another egg or two. "We'll have that done for you by this evening, your majesties".

"Eggcellent!" said the king, clearly relieved.

The foolish prince, trying to save face, said his new egg could be ready ... soon.

"Oh dear" said the king, sternly.  "Well... better laid than never".  And off he went to discuss the wise prince's reward.
